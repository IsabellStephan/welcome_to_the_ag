# Home Office

In times with or without COVID-19 :mask:

Find all forms in Charité Intranet or under:
Owncloud -> AG_Lernen_und_Kognition -> Formulare -> VPN

## Set up VPN

This is for accessing the virtual desktop environment provided by Charité but will usually not give you access to data and programs (such as Matlab) at once. 


### Establish basic VPN

if you do not have a Personalnr.
```
VPN-Antrag_Extern
```

if you have one:
```
VPN-Antrag_Mitarb_Stud
```

both can be filled out by yourself/no stamp/signatures needed

### Establish access to Charité VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)

If you need access to /S, /T or Microsoft Office or PEP you need the following:

```
VPN-Zusatzantrag_O Stufe 1
```
Just check  the box next to 'Office-VDI' under Erweiterte Berechtigung Stufe 1 and ensure that you do not have access to "Daten mit hohem Schutzbedarf" etc. at the bottom
Now you need the stamp by Prof. Heinz, therefore send it to his secretary (nadine.roth@charite.de)



## Set up Remote Desktop

This will give you access to a specific computer (as long as these are still set up in CCM or elsewhere) and therefore access to /S and the programs at once
However, it is only possible that one person logs into one computer at a time. Select a computer that won't be used by a lot of other people and that you have Admin rights for. The computer needs to be switched on, and nobody needs to be logged in.

```
VPN-Zusatzantrag_O Stufe 3
```
Under Erweiterte Berechtigung Stufe 3 fill in 'RDP' next to Dienste and the name of your computer (c15....) next to Zielsystem
Now you need the stamp by Prof. Heinz, therefore send it to his secretary (nadine.roth@charite.de)

### For Mac Users :computer:

You need Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac. You can download it here

* [Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12)

You then need to establish a VPN  to the intranet of Charité (e.g. via Tunnelblick) and than you can start the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client and enter the domain Name CHARTIE\yourusername and the PC name c15... :zap:
